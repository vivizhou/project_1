# This is the project for the Data Science nanodegree program at Udacity.

You will find the codes in the file unicorn_companies.ipynb.
I downloaded the unicorn companies dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/unicorn-companies-dataset), because I am interested in investment of unicorn companies. With the dataset I answered three questions:

1. Which countries have more unicorn companies?
2. What is the industry distribution of the unicorn companies? How is it different between United States and China?
3. Which 10 unicorn companies we may keep our eyes on for future investment.

The results were posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@vivizhouxw02/10-unicorn-companies-you-may-want-to-keep-an-eye-on-for-investment-c1363b76b407).
>(Note I was only able to submit one link for Github Repo.)
